Sure! Here are the essential terms and definitions for flashcards based on the given information:

1. var: A keyword used in JavaScript to declare variables (historically used before let and const became common).

2. let: A keyword used in JavaScript to declare variables with block scope. It allows reassignment of values but not redeclaration in the same scope.

3. const: A keyword used in JavaScript to declare variables with block scope. It is similar to let but with the additional restriction that the variable's value cannot be reassigned.

4. Block scope: The area within curly braces ({}) where variables are defined and accessible.

5. Redeclaration: The act of declaring a variable again with the same name in the same scope.

6. String template literals: A feature in JavaScript that allows embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`). They enable easier string interpolation and multiline strings.

7. Scoping rules: Rules that determine the accessibility and lifespan of variables in different parts of the code.

8. Reassignment: Modifying the value of a variable after it has been declared.

9. Constant: A value that remains the same and cannot be changed once assigned.

10. let vs. const: The differences between the let and const keywords in JavaScript, including reassignment and redeclaration rules.

Remember to include examples and practice using these terms to reinforce your understanding. Happy studying!
