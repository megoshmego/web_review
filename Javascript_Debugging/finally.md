Demonstration:

In this video, the instructor introduces the concept of the "finally" block, which is used in error handling alongside the try and catch blocks. The finally block contains code that will run regardless of whether an error was thrown or caught.

The instructor demonstrates an example where an undefined method is called within a try block. In the catch block, the error is caught and logged. After that, the finally block is executed, and its code is logged. The demonstration shows that the finally block always runs, whether an error was thrown or not.

The instructor mentions that the finally block can be useful in situations where you need to ensure a particular action is performed regardless of errors, such as closing a file after attempting to write to it. The demonstration showcases an example where the finally block closes the file, even if there was no catch block.

The instructor concludes by emphasizing that the finally block will always run, regardless of whether an error was caught, uncaught, or if there was no error at all.

Overall, the video provides a concise overview of the finally block in error handling, emphasizing its purpose and demonstrating its behavior in different scenarios.
