This transcript discusses the anatomy of an error message and the importance of error message information for debugging. Here is a breakdown of the important terms and ideas mentioned:

1. Anatomy of an Error Message: The transcript explains that an error message provides useful information for locating and resolving errors in code. It consists of various details, including the type of error and specific information about the file and line number where the error occurred.

2. Locating Errors: The file name and line number provided in an error message are crucial for identifying the exact location of the error in the code. This information becomes particularly valuable in larger projects with multiple files.

3. Googling Error Messages: When encountering an error message, using search engines like Google can be helpful for finding solutions. It is recommended to omit specific file names and line numbers from the search query to get more relevant results.

4. Debugging Non-Native Tools: When working with external libraries or tools that are not built into the programming language, encountering unfamiliar error messages is common. Googling these error messages can provide valuable insights and solutions, especially when working with tools like jQuery, Axios, React, or other third-party libraries.

To demonstrate the concepts discussed, let's consider an example:

Suppose you encounter the following error message: "ReferenceError: functionA is not defined at app.js line 15." In this case, the important information is the type of error (ReferenceError) and the location (app.js, line 15).

By omitting the specific file name and line number, you can search for solutions to the general error message "ReferenceError: functionA is not defined." This approach will provide you with relevant results and potential solutions to resolve the error.

Remember that googling error messages is a common and valuable practice for developers, regardless of their experience level.
