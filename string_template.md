Terms and definitions:

1. String Template Literal: A syntax in JavaScript that allows for easy interpolation of variables or expressions within a string. It uses backticks (`) instead of quotes and uses `${}` to enclose the variables or expressions.

2. Concatenation: The process of combining two or more strings together. In JavaScript, it is typically done using the plus (+) operator.

3. Interpolation: The act of inserting variables or expressions into a string. In the context of string template literals, interpolation allows for dynamic values to be included in the string without the need for concatenation.

4. Backtick: A character (`) used to denote the start and end of a string template literal in JavaScript.

5. Dollar Sign ($): A symbol used within string template literals to indicate the start of an interpolated expression.

6. Curly Braces: Characters ({}) used within string template literals to enclose interpolated variables or expressions.

7. Concatenation: The process of combining two or more strings together. In JavaScript, it is typically done using the plus (+) operator.

8. Expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that results in a single value. In the context of string template literals, expressions can be evaluated and included within the resulting string.

9. Visualize: To mentally picture or understand the structure and appearance of something. In the context of string template literals, the syntax allows for easier visualization of the final string by placing variables and expressions within the template.

10. Syntax: The set of rules and conventions that dictate the structure and format of a programming language or code. In the context of string template literals, it refers to the specific way in which variables and expressions are included within the template.
