Here are the important terms for mastering the subject, along with a few additional helpful terms:

1. Error Handling: The process of managing and dealing with errors in code to prevent crashes and ensure a better user experience.

2. Debugging: The process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in code to make it work correctly.

3. Try/Catch: JavaScript keywords used for error handling. The "try" block contains the code that might throw an error, while the "catch" block catches and handles the error.

4. Uncaught Error: An error that is not handled or caught, causing the program to stop execution and display an error message.

5. Error Types: Different types of errors that can occur in JavaScript, such as ReferenceError, TypeError, SyntaxError, etc.

6. Block Scope: A scope that defines the visibility and accessibility of variables within a specific block of code.

7. Catch Parameter: A variable specified in the catch block to hold information about the error that was caught.

8. Invalid Inputs: Inputs that do not meet the expected format or requirements of a function or program.

9. Error Message: Information displayed when an error occurs, providing details about the type of error, file, and line number where it occurred.

10. Googling Error Messages: The process of searching for solutions to errors by using search engines like Google and providing the error message as the search query.

11. Debugging Non-Native Tools: The process of debugging errors in external libraries or tools that are not part of the core programming language.

12. SyntaxError: A type of error that occurs when the code violates the syntax rules of the programming language.

13. ReferenceError: A type of error that occurs when an undefined variable or function is referenced.

14. TypeError: A type of error that occurs when an operation is performed on a value of an inappropriate type.

15. Stack Trace: A detailed report of the function calls and their sequence that led to the error.

16. Console.log: A method used to print messages to the console for debugging purposes.

17. Breakpoints: Points in the code where the debugger pauses the execution to allow inspection and analysis.

18. Step Over: A debugging command that executes the current line of code and moves to the next line without stepping into any function calls.

19. Step Into: A debugging command that steps into the next function call, allowing inspection of its internal code.

20. Step Out: A debugging command that steps out of the current function and returns to the calling code.

By understanding and mastering these terms, you will be well-equipped to handle errors, debug your code effectively, and enhance the overall quality of your JavaScript programs.
